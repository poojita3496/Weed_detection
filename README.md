Weed Population Detection in Live Grass Using Modified Backpropagation Algorithm This project involves detecting weed populations in live grass.The project is implemented in MATLAB and includes training and testing scripts along with necessary datasets.

MATLAB Source Codes

Training(weed detection).m

This script describes the implementation of Standard Backpropagation (SBP) and Modified Backpropagation (MBP) algorithms.

Key Features:

-Trains a neural network with a (3-8-1) layer configuration.

-Outputs a scatter plot of network responses.

-Displays performance index curves.

Required Data Files:

-train_weed.txt

-validate_weed.txt

-test_weed.txt

These files must be in the current working directory (CWD).

Testing(weed detection).m

This script is used to test the network performance under different weather conditions. To use it, copy any reflectance data file and place it in the CWD with the name eval_weed.txt.

Key Features:

-Outputs a scatter plot showing network responses.
